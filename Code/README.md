Execution of the program :

./main.py <problem-file> <final-result-file> <SAT-solver> <sat-To-3-Sat>

If you enter "input" in < problem-file >, you will be guided to input your own instantiation.

The SAT-solver can be "minisat" (a common SAT-solver) or "walksat" (our own SAT-solver).

If <sat-To-3-Sat> is not empty, all the clauses will be of length 3.
